Since I got my Mac mini, I've been trying to customize my system like the cool kids at r/unixporn. Specifically, I was inspired by this post. I instantly fell in love with the Ros√© Pine theme. A soft, muted palette that is also vaguely feminine? Sign me up!

As far as tinkering with the Mac goes, the Apple Terminal wasn't doing it for me. Maybe it's because I wanted to experiment with different terminal emulators like Alacritty. Since I was drinking the dumb bitch juice with trying to import the themes into Alacritty, I decided to go with iTerm2.

As a bonus, I'll quickly mention a different color palette for Alacritty on Linux (tokyo-night).

I thought I would have a little fun documenting my incompetence once again.
